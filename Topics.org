Organizers: Duncan Temple Lang & Jerome Braun

The idea is to identify, become familiar with and discuss and compare
technologies that are used increasingly in research and industry in
the area of "Data Sciences". We'll explore these together informally
by collectively educating each other.

The following are some sample topics we might discuss. This is
intentionally vague and incomplete. I strongly encourage each of you
to suggest others. Just send me mail.

Also, I really want and expect people to volunteer to research one of
these or other related topics and to give a presentation. You don't
have to be an expert in the topic, just interested in exploring it and
willing to spend time investigating it with my help and guidance as
you want it. You can partner and work with somebody and give a joint
presentation Please email if you have identified a topic and are
willing to give a talk.
