<h1>Brown Bag Seminar on Technologies for Data Sciences</h1>

Organizers:  Duncan Temple Lang &amp; Jerome Braun

<p/> The idea is to identify, become familiar with and discuss and
compare technologies that are used increasingly in research and
industry in the area of "Data Sciences".  We'll explore these
together informally by collectively educating each other.

<p>
The following are some sample topics we might discuss.
This is intentionally vague and incomplete. 
I strongly encourage each of you to suggest others.
Just send me mail.
<p>
Also, I really want and expect people to volunteer
to research one of these or other related topics
and to give a presentation.  You don't have to be an expert
in the topic, just interested in exploring it and willing
to spend time investigating it with my help and guidance
as you want it.  You can partner and work with somebody and
give a joint presentation
Please email if you have identified a topic and are willing
to give a talk.
